# DICE-Anomaly-Detection-Regression-Based-Tool
## Introduction
Every new code commit might potentially introduce changes resulting in the performance degradation and anomalous behaviour of the application under development. Regression-Based Anomaly Detection Tool (RBADT) aims to help software developers to flag potential anomalies at every new code deployment.


## Architecture
The high-level architecture of the tool is shown on the Figure below:

## Installation
Regression-based Anomaly Detection tool is implemented in Matlab and packaged to be run as a standalone application from the browser or command line (does not require Matlab to be installed). MyAppInstaller_web.exe is an installer of the MATLAB Generated Standalone Application.

### Configuration files

Configuration parameters for the tool are supplied via the configuration file <i>config_main.txt</i>, and input data for model training (except for observations, which are obtained from the DICE monitoring platform) via <i>config_factors.txt</i>. These files preferably should be placed into the same directory as an installed application for convenience, but it is not a strict requirement. 

Configuration file <i>config_main.txt</i> contains the following parameters:

1. <b>Metric</b> - performance metric to train a statistical model for, set by the developer. Should be entered in the same syntax as it's called in the DICE monitoring platform (D-Mon). This parameter currently is not used by the tool, because it is not integrated yet with D-Mon.
2. <b>Budget_constr</b> (Yes/No). Indicates whether developer is limited by how many observation points they can obtain for the model training step (general rule: the more datapoints available - the better performance model will be, but more expensive - more times to run application under test are needed).
3. <b>Budget</b> (integer value or empty). If there is a time/money limitation on obtaining training data, indicate maximum number of experiments you can afford, else leave it empty.
4. <b>Mode</b> (manual/automated). Tool currently supports only manual mode. In this mode developer provides to the tool the list of inputs for the model training (e.g. application configuration parameters, hardware parameters etc.) with their settings (low and high) via <i>config_factors.txt</i> file (see the file for an example input). In automated mode this list will be supplied by the DICE deployment tool.
5. <b>R2</b> (default value 0.85). Parameter defining the minimum desired goodness of fit for the trained model (general rule: the lower this value, the less datapoints are needed to train the model, but the model predictive capability also diminishes).
6. <b>p_value</b> (default 0.05). Parameter defining the certainty with which the terms (from the list of input parameters) should be included into the trained model. General rule is similar to the R2: the higher this value (e.g 0.1), the less experiments would be needed to obtain observations for model fitting. However, this would increase the risk of including input parameters into the model which are noise (don't influence performance metric being modelled).
7. <b>Version_to_compare</b>. Here enter the version number of your application's deployment with which you want to compare the performance model that will be trained for your the most recent deployment. The tool will retrieve the corresponding performance model from the model repository. Currently there is no application under test and RBADT works in the demo mode (see more detailed explanation of the demo mode below).

Configuration file <i>config_factors.txt</i> contains five Spark configuration parameters with settings (low and high) for the open-source Machine Learning application <a href="oryx.io">Oryx 2</a>. Oryx 2 was run with all possible combinations of these settings (32) to obtain datapoints of the batch processing time metric simulating Data-Intensive Application (DIA) under test for the RBADT. Where in the software development environment the tool will be running the DIA and collecting one data point per each model training step from the monitoring platform, in the current version it's picking one datapoint from this 32 observations' dataset. The Oryx 2 dataset serves as a demo and this feature will be replaced with the interfaces to the DICE deployment tool and DICE monitoring platform on the integration stage (see more detailed explanation of the demo mode below).


### Run RBADT

After the tool is installed and configuration files are added and modified to the developer's specifications, RBADT can be executed by running RBAD.exe file by clicking on it in browser window or providing the path to it in the command line.

If you choose to run the RBAD tool in command line, please refer to the following steps:

1. 1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the folder into which you installed the application. <br />
   If you accepted the default settings, you can find the folder in one of the following locations: <br />
<table>

<tr>

<td>Windows</td>
<td>C:\Program Files\RBAD</td>

</tr>

<td>Mac OS X</td>
<td>/Applications/RBAD</td>

<tr>

<td>Linux</td>
<td>/usr/RBAD</td>

</tr>


</table>
3. Run the application using the one of the following commands: <br />

<table>

<tr>

<td>Windows</td>
<td>application\RBAD</td>

</tr>

<td>Mac OS X</td>
<td>./RBAD.app/Contents/MacOS/RBAD</td>

<tr>

<td>Linux</td>
<td>./RBAD</td>

</tr>


</table>

## Demo mode

As there are currently no DIA in development to test for anomalies or anomalies-injection tool available, as well as RBADT is not yet integrated with other DICE tools, the tool works in the demo mode. This includes: <br />
1. DIA performance model is created using (some) observations from the 32-point dataset obtained by running Oryx 2 (instead of running a DIA each time when a datapoint is needed and collecting it from the D-Mon). <br />
2. Versioned model repository is implemented as a readable/writable data structure (cell array), where model of the previous deployment (version_to_compare=1) is the Oryx 2 performance model (for batch processing times) with an addition of the term -40*executor-cores (to generate the report message after the comparison of two models). <br />
3. The trained model is not saved into the model repository (this functionality is implemented, but commented out), because it will be the same on every tool execution. 

## Report generation

In the integrated mode it is envisioned that RBADT will be providing information that will be displayed either in D-Mon or DICE IDE. For now the tool generates a <i>report*.txt file</i>, where * stands for the current deployment version. The file contains one or more of the following messages:

<table>

<tr>

<td>a)</td>
<td>The problem is in *name of the input parameter(s)*</td>
<td>If the tool detected performance degradation caused by the change in this input parameter (or multiple parameters)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>b)</td>
<td>Disappearance of *name of the input parameter(s)* caused anomalous behaviour</td>
<td>If one or more input parameters were present in the "old" model and its (their) disappearance caused performance degradation</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>c)</td>
<td>Appearance of *name of the input parameter(s)* caused anomalous behaviour</td>
<td>If one or more input parameters were absent in the "old" model and its (their) appearance caused performance degradation</td>

</tr>

</table>

If no anomalies detected the file will report "No anomalies detected".

The report generated by this demo version returns the message from the case b), because model of the version 1 contained the artificially added term "-40*executor-cores", which was significantly reducing batch processing time. It does not exist in the real (Oryx 2) model, therefore the relevant message was generated. <br />
